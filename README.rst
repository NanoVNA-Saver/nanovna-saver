NanoVNASaver
============

A multiplatform tool to save Touchstone files from the NanoVNA,
sweep frequency spans in segments to gain more than 101 data
points, and generally display and analyze the resulting data.


* Copyright 2019, 2020 Rune B. Broberg
* Copyright 2020ff NanoVNA-Saver Authors

It's developed in **Python 3 (>=3.8)** using **PyQt6**, **numpy** and
**scipy**.


Introduction
------------

This software connects to a NanoVNA and extracts the data for
display on a computer and allows saving the sweep data to Touchstone files.

:raw-html-m2r:`<a href="#current-features"></a>`

Current features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Reading data from a NanoVNA -- Compatible devices: NanoVNA, NanoVNA-H,
  NanoVNA-H4, NanoVNA-F, AVNA via Teensy
* Reading data from a TinySA
* Splitting a frequency range into multiple segments to increase resolution
  (tried up to >10k points)
* Averaging data for better results particularly at higher frequencies
* Displaying data on multiple chart types, such as Smith, LogMag, Phase and
  VSWR-charts, for both S11 and S21
* Displaying markers, and the impedance, VSWR, Q, equivalent
  capacitance/inductance etc. at these locations
* Displaying customizable frequency bands as reference, for example amateur
  radio bands
* Exporting and importing 1-port and 2-port Touchstone files
* TDR function (measurement of cable length) - including impedance display
* Filter analysis functions for low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and band-stop
  filters
* Display of both an active and a reference trace
* Live updates of data from the NanoVNA, including for multi-segment sweeps
* In-application calibration, including compensation for non-ideal calibration
  standards
* Customizable display options, including "dark mode"
* Exporting images of plotted values

Running the application
-----------------------

Main development is currently done on Linux (Mint 21 "Vanessa" Cinnamon)

Installation
------------

Binary releases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can find current binary releases for Windows, Linux and MacOS under
https://github.com/NanoVNA-Saver/nanovna-saver/releases/latest

The 32bit Windows binaries are somewhat smaller and seems to be a
little bit more stable.

`Detailed installation instructions <docs/INSTALLATION.md>`_

Using the software
------------------

Connect your NanoVNA to a serial port, and enter this serial port in the serial
port box.  If the NanoVNA is connected before the application starts, it should
be automatically detected. Otherwise, click "Rescan". Click "Connect to device"
to connect.

The app can collect multiple segments to get more accurate measurements. Enter
the number of segments to be done in the "Segments" box. Each segment is 101
data points, and takes about 1.5 seconds to complete.

Frequencies are entered in Hz, or suffixed with k or M.  Scientific notation
(6.5e6 for 6.5MHz) also works.

Markers can be manually entered, or controlled using the mouse. For mouse
control, select the active marker using the radio buttons, or hold "shift"
while clicking to drag the nearest marker. The marker readout boxes show the
actual frequency where values are measured.  Marker readouts can be hidden
using the "hide data" button when not needed.

Display settings are available under "Display setup". These allow changing the
chart colours, the application font size and which graphs are displayed.  The
settings are saved between program starts.

Calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^

*Before using NanoVNA-Saver, please ensure that the device itself is in a
reasonable calibration state.*

A calibration of both ports across the entire frequency span, saved to save
slot 0, is sufficient.  If the NanoVNA is completely uncalibrated, its readings
may be outside the range accepted by the application.

In-application calibration is available, either assuming ideal standards or
with relevant standard correction. To manually calibrate, sweep each standard
in turn and press the relevant button in the calibration window.
For assisted calibration, press the "Calibration Assistant" button.  If desired,
enter a note in the provided field describing the conditions under which the
calibration was performed.

Calibration results may be saved and loaded using the provided buttons at the
bottom of the window.  Notes are saved and loaded along with the calibration
data.

Users of known characterized calibration standard sets can enter the data for
these, and save the sets.

After pressing *Apply*\ , the calibration is immediately applied to the latest
sweep data.

! *Currently, load capacitance is unsupported* !

TDR
^^^

To get accurate TDR measurements, calibrate the device, and attach the cable to
be measured at the calibration plane - i.e. at the same position where the
calibration load would be attached.  Open the "Time Domain Reflectometry"
window, and select the correct cable type, or manually enter a propagation
factor.

Measuring inductor core permeability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The permeability (mu) of cores can be measured using a one-port measurement.
Put one or more windings on a core of known dimensions and use the "S11 mu"
plot from the "Display Setup".  The core dimensions (cross section area in mm2,
effective length in mm) and number of windings can be set in the context menu
for the plot (right click on the plot).

Latest Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Using PyQt6
* Moved to PyScaffold project structure
* Fixed crash in resonance analysis
* Added TinySA readout and screenshot


Changes in 0.5.5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Measuring inductor core permeability
* Bugfixes for calibration data loading and saving
* Let V2 Devices more time for usb-serial setup
* Make some windows scrollable

Changes in 0.5.4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Bugfixes for Python3.11 compatability
* Bugfix for Python3.8 compatability
