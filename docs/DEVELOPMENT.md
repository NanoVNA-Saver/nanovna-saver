# Development Process

## Local Development Environment

Prerequerements:

1. Python > 3.10. Using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) / [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) may be requered to test comaptibility with different python versions.
2. [Astral UV v1.8.x](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). May be installed via [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/installation/).

## Local Run and Debugging

Following commands to prepare local env and run application or run tests:

* `uv sync` - prepare virtual environment and install prod and dev dependencies
* `uv run ui-compile` - compile Qt resources. Should be executed before first `uv run NanoVNASaver` run
* `uv run NanoVNASaver` - run local instance
* `uv run task test` - run unit tests in current venv
* `uv run task test-cov` - run unit tests in current venv and display test coverage report
* `uv run task test-full` - run unit tests for all avialable python versions
* `uv run task clean` - remove temporally artifacts (dist, build, *.pyc etc)
* `uv run task lint` - check sources and try to fix issues

## Development Routines

A few usefull commands:

* ðŸš§ TODO: - update dependencies in `pyproject.toml` respecting specified version constraints.
* ðŸš§ TODO: - update dependencies ignoring in `pyproject.toml` specified version constraints.
* `uv lock` - update dependency lock file respecting specified version constraints.

## UI Development

UI layout of Widget, Dialogs and Window stored in `*.ui` files and may be edited by QT Designer. Please use `uv run pyside6-designer` or `uv run task ui-designer` to launch QT Designer. Please note

* UI layout should be creatd and stored via UI files
  * fields name should follow python_snake_style_naming scheme
  * elements should have meaningful names and initial values
  * elements which are not going to be changed during runtime should have `_` prefix
* Icons, images and other resources should be stored as part of `main.qrc` file.
  * compiled resource files (e.g. `main_rc.py`) should not be put under git version control
  * ui and resource files may be compiled manually via `uv run task compile` or will be executed automatically during `uv build` phase.

## Build Process

### Python packages

A `uv build` may be used to prepare python packages. Version would be taken from git repository.

### Windows Exeutables

Pre requirements:

* Python 3.10-3.12
* uv (see `Local Development Environment` for more details)

Execute `uv run task build-pkg-win` to get `dist\nanovna-sever*.exe` file.

### Linux Executables

Pre requirements:

* Python 3.10-3.12
* uv (see `Local Development Environment` for more details)
* Some X11 packages preinstalled

An example for Ubuntu 22.04:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install -y python3.11 python3-pip python3.11-venv \
    python3.11-dev \
    '^libxcb.*-dev' libx11-xcb-dev \
    libglu1-mesa-dev libxrender-dev libxi-dev \
    libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev
```

Execute `uv run task build-pkg-linux` to get `dist/nanovna-sever*` file.

### Linux Flatpack

ðŸš§ TODO: describe me

### MacOS Package

Pre requirements:

* Python 3.10-3.12
* uv (see `Local Development Environment` for more details)
* PyQt >=6.4 installed (`brew install pyqt`)

Execute `uv run task build-pkg-macos` to get `dist/NanoVNASaver.app*.exe` file.

## Publish Process

Please configure pypi credentials, create git tag and execute `uv publish` command. Please refer [UV :: publish](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) for more details.

ðŸš§ TODO: describe git tag creation and next version selection
ðŸš§ TODO: build and publish platform specific artefacts: deb, native bin, flatpack packages
