# Development Process

## Local Development Environment

Prerequerements:

1. Python > 3.10. Using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) / [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) may be requered to test comaptibility with different python versions.
2. [Poetry v1.8.x](https://python-poetry.org/docs/1.8/#installation). May be installed via [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/installation/).
3. Poetry plugins:

* ðŸš§ TODO: testing and cleaning tasks
 
## Development Routines

A few usefull commands:

* `poetry up` - update dependencies in `pyproject.toml` respecting specified version constraints.
* `poetry up --latest` - update dependencies ignoring in `pyproject.toml` specified version constraints.
* `poetry update` - update dependency lock file respecting specified version constraints.

## Build Process

A `poetry build` may be used to prepare python packages. Version would be taken from git repository.

ðŸš§ TODO: build platform specific artefacts: deb, native bin, flatpack packages

## Publish Process
