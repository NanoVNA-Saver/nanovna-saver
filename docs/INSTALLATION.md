# Installation Instructions

## Installation and Use with pipx
For installation it is recommended to use pipx instead of pip.  Most installations nowadays require the usage of a virtual environment when using pip, pipx automatically arranges this for you.

Installing the latest release with pipx install. e.g.:

    pipx install git+https://github.com/NanoVNA-Saver/nanovna-saver

Or if you want to install a specific version use:

    pipx install git+https://github.com/NanoVNA-Saver/nanovna-saver@v0.7.3

Once completed run with the following command: `NanoVNASaver`

## Installing via DEB for Debian (and Ubuntu)
ðŸš§ TODO: this is currently broken

The installation has the benefit that it allows you to run the program from anywhere, because the
main program is found via the regular `$PATH` and the modules are located in the Python module path.

If you're using a debian based distro you should consider to build your own `*.deb` package.
This has the advantage that NanoVNASaver can be installed and uninstalled cleanly in the system.

For this you need to install `python3-stdeb` - the module for converting Python code and modules into a Debian package:

    apt install python3-stdeb

Then you can build the package via:

    make deb

This package can be installed the usual way with

    sudo dpkg -i nanovnasaver....deb
or

   sudo apt install ./nanovnasaver....deb

### Installing via RPM (experimental)
ðŸš§ TODO: this is currently broken

`make rpm` builds an (untested) rpm package that can be installed on your system the usual way.
