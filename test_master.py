# Executing this file initiates the discovery and execution of all unittests
# in the "test" directory, with filenames starting with "test" that have a
# TestCases(unittest.TestCase) Class, which has class functions starting with
# "test_". This provides a simple test framework that is easily expandable by
# simply adding new "test_xxx.py" files into the test directory.
